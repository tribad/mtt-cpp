# Integration into StarUML
This directory contains a little helper to run the code generator from within staruml.

At least on my linux box I needed to copy the whole folder "mtt-cpp" to "~/.config/StarUML/extensions/user"
After a restart you can run the generator with CTRL+ALT+x
The generator must be reachable through your PATH environment variable.
