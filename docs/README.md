# Introduction

Even the code genrator is mainly developed to be used with StarUML models it has been later extended for the Enterprise
Architect. So it already showed its extensibility for different UML modelers.

It uses a more lean UML model, than the original UML-Meta-Model from the OMG.
The documentation does not contain a UML modeling guideline or any extensive tutorial about how to create useful models.

Only in cases where a deeper look into the topics is needed to better understand how things work some deeper help will be given.

## Structure

The documentation is split into an architectural part and a user manual.

* [Architecture](architecture/architecture.md)
* [User Manual](user/manual.md)
